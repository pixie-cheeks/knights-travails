# Knights Travails

It was easy for the most part, but I had a really hard time figuring out how to trace the path back from the endpoint to the starting point. Saw the wikipedia article for [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), and saw that they just passed square wrapped in an object with the parent property to the queue.

I felt stupid for not thinking about it earlier, but it's easy to not see the obvious solution when your mind is fixated on solving it. So, I don't feel about it.
